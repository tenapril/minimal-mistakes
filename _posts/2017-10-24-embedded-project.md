This is one of my project for Embedded System Course in my Uni.

What me and my friend use here is :

 - Arduino UNO R3
 - Bluetooth HC-05
 - 2 Motors for X and Y Servo
 - 1 Used DVD motor and chasis for Z movement
 - Adaptor
 - PVC Pipe
 - Android to control the AS/RS
 
 **Source Code** is available on my github: [here](https://github.com/tenapril/Automated-Warehouse-Arduino) 
     
 If you have any question as of how to make this, feel free to contact me :)
